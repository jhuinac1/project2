        description: "The 2015 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon has a deep, rich red color with a purple rim. A robust wine with an assertive and alluring attack, it has notes of strawberry, cigar and tea leaves with a touch of black pepper and clove. A mouthwatering mid-palate of raspberry is followed by an expressive and bright finish. With lush and silky tannins, this ageworthy wine will show beautifully through 2038 given proper cellaring conditions.",

        description: "The color on the 2015 San Filippo Brunello di Montalcino Le Lucere is a ruby red with reflexes verging on garnet. The perfume is intense, fine and elegant, with notes of cherries preserved in alcohol, enriched with spices redolent of cinnamon and cloves. On the palate it explodes in all its fineness and elegance thanks to the dense and silky tannins. Excellent body that renders the flavor harmonious and persistent. Excellent nose-mouth correspondence.",

It goes well with pastries and gourmet chocolate like gianduja. Extraordinary alone, as a meditation wine.",
